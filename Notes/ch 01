- c++ is case sensetive.

Comments:-
- Comments in any programming language are used to document your code (program), to allow others to understand your code.
- comments, white spaces, and blank lines are ignored by the compiler, and don't cause the program to perform any action.
-there are two types of comments in cpp:
 1- single line comment => //this is a comment
 2- multi-line comment=> /*this is a comment*/

prprocessor dirctive:
- are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#)
- #include is a Preprocessor directive 
-These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. 
-The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements.
-#include<iostream> This line notifies the preprocessor to include in the program the contents of the input/output stream header <iostream>
-When the preprocessor encounters this directive, it replaces any occurrence of identifier in the rest of the code by replacement.
-This replacement can be an expression, a statement, a block or simply anything. 

-To define preprocessor macros we can use #define. Its syntax is:
-#define identifier replacement => #define ll long long 
-#define TABLE_SIZE 100


-keyword => is a word in code that is reserved by C++ for a specific use.
- cout << "hello, world"; => the quotation marks and the characters between them are called a string, a character string or a string literal.
- << stream insertion operator. cout << 
- >> stream extraction operator. cin >> 
-  ">>" operator in C++ is called the extraction operator because it is used to extract data from an input stream, such as reading from a file or keyboard.
- The "<<" operator is called the insertion operator because it is used to insert data into an output stream, such as writing to a file or screen. 

- common programming error => syntax error (compiler error or compile-time-error)

- \ is called escape character .
- When a backslash is encountered in a string of characters, the next character is combined with the backslash to form an escape sequence.
-The escape sequence "\n" means newline.

-A variable name is any valid identifier that is not a keyword.
- An identifier is a series of characters consisting of letters, digits and underscores ( _ ). Identifiers cannot start with a digit.

-Every variable stored in the computer’s memory has a name, a value, a type and a size.
-Whenever a new value is placed in a memory location, the process is destructive i.e., the new value replaces the previous value in that location. The previous value is lost.
-When a value is read from memory, the process is nondestructive  i.e., a copy of the value is read, leaving the original value undisturbed in the memory location.
-The std::endl stream manipulator outputs a newline, then “flushes the output buffer.”

-C++ arithmetic operators => + , - , / , % , *
- precedence of C++ arithmetic operators => () , / * % , + - => if there are several of / % * they are evaluated left to right.

-c++ equality and relationl operator  > , >= , < , <= , == , !=

- precedence and associativity of the operators explained so far:
  - ()
  - * / %
  - + - 
  - << >> 
  - < <= >= > 
  - ==  !=
  - =
